      <h1>Economics The Game</h1>
      <p>Disclaimer: Economics The Game is based off of an old flash game that I can't remember the name of.</p>
      <p>Disclaimer: Economics The Game is a joke, it is hyper critical of all economic systems and their downfalls and shouldn't be taken seriously.</p>
      <p>Every gamemode is played using the W A and D keys moving the character up, left, and right respectively. Collide with the falling money to collect it. </p>
      <p>Choose one of the game modes: Capitalism, Communism, or Socialism to begin playing or choose Clear Game to reset the game. </p>
      <p>Capitalism The Game: you and two AIs are competing to collect the most money, for every dollar you gain you grow 1%, thanks to compound interest that will have you huge in no time! Make sure you act quickly, the richer you are the easier it is to make money (just like the real world). To win become a giant first, and don't fall off.</p>
      <p>Communism The Game: you and two AIs are competing to collect the most money.. for The State that is, unfortunately for you since The State gets all of your money, you don't grow, but it sure does. To win find out how to stop collecting money for the state. </p>
      <p>Socialism The Game: you and two AIs are competing to become a giant first.. fortunately for those who had troubles with Capitalism The Game, profits are split universally, well the ones you worked for are anyway.. To win become a giant and fall before the AI does (or find another way). </p>
